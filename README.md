# sol-namor (alpha)

Looking at long, cryptic public keys or trying to remember them is painful.

This package solves that by generating fun (deterministic) human-readable names from Solana addresses â€” or uses the actual known name for popular addresses (for example, exchanges).

## Install

`npm i sol-namor`

## Usage

```
const { getSolanaName } = require("sol-namor");

const pubKey = "enter a solana public key here";

getSolanaName(pubKey);
```
